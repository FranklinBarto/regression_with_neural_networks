## Linear and Autoregressive Models with TensorFlow
This repository demonstrates how to implement simple linear regression and autoregressive models using TensorFlow's Keras API. We explore how linear regression can model simple linear relationships and how autoregressive models can be used for more complex patterns, such as a sine wave.
